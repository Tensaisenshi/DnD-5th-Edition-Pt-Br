particularly alder, ash, birch, elder, hazel, holly, juniper, mistletoe, oak, rowan, willow, and yew. Druids often use such plants as part of a spellcasting focus, incorporating lengths of oak or yew or sprigs of mistletoe.</p>\n<p>Similarly, a druid uses such woods to make other objects, such as weapons and shields. Yew is associated with death and rebirth, so weapon handles for scimitars or sickles might be fashioned from it. Ash is associated with life and oak with strength. These woods make excellent hafts or whole weapons, such as clubs or quarterstaffs, as well as shields. Alder is associated with air, and it might be used for thrown weapons, such as darts or javelins.</p>\n<p>Druids from regions that lack the plants described here have chosen other plants to take on similar uses. For instance, a druid of a desert region might value the yucca tree and cactus plants.</p>\n<h3>Druids and the Gods</h3>\n<p>Some druids venerate the forces of nature themselves, but most druids are devoted to one of the many nature deities worshiped in the multiverse (the lists of gods in <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-pack=\"dnd5e.rules\" data-id=\"2JNtWRo7wMq08bXn\"><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i> appendix PH-B</a> include many such deities). The worship of these deities is often considered a more ancient tradition than the faiths of clerics and urbanized peoples. </p>\n<h1>Druid Circles</h1>\n<h2>Circle of the Land</h2>\n<p>The Circle of the Land is made up of mystics and sages who safeguard ancient knowledge and rites through a vast oral tradition. These druids meet within sacred circles of trees or standing stones to whisper primal secrets in Druidic. The circle’s wisest members preside as the chief priests of communities that hold to the Old Faith and serve as advisors to the rulers of those folk. As a member of this circle, your magic is influenced by the land where you were initiated into the circle’s mysterious rites.</p>\n<h3>Circle of the Land Features</h3>\n<p>2nd Level: <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-pack=\"dnd5e.classfeatures\" data-id=\"lT8GsPOPgRzDC3QJ\"><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i> Bonus Cantrip</a> <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-pack=\"dnd5e.classfeatures\" data-id=\"wKdRtFsvGfMKQHLY\"><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i> Natural Recovery</a></p>\n<p>3rd, 5th, 7th, 9th Level: <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-pack=\"dnd5e.classfeatures\" data-id=\"YiK59gWSlcQ6Mbdz\"><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i> Circle Spells</a></p>\n<p>6th Level: <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-pack=\"dnd5e.classfeatures\" data-id=\"3FB25qKxmkmxcxuC\"><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i> Land's Stride (Circle of the Land)</a></p>\n<p>10th Level: <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-pack=\"dnd5e.classfeatures\" data-id=\"OTvrJSJSUgAwXrWX\"><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i> Nature's Ward</a></p>\n<p>14th Level: <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-pack=\"dnd5e.classfeatures\" data-id=\"EuX1kJNIw1F68yus\"><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i> Nature's Sanctuary</a></p>"

You might find other spells during your adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard’s chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Copying a Spell into the Book.</strong></em> When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a spell level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it.</p>\n<p>Copying that spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation.</p>\n<p>For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Replacing the Book.</strong></em> You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book—for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell.</p>\n<p>If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place.</p>\n<p><em><strong>The Book’s Appearance.</strong></em> Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume that you received as a gift from your master, a finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous spellbook in a mishap.</p>\n<h1>Arcane Traditions</h1>\n<p>The study of wizardry is ancient, stretching back to the earliest mortal discoveries of magic. It is firmly established in fantasy gaming worlds, with various traditions dedicated to its complex study.</p>\n<p>The most common arcane traditions in the multiverse revolve around the schools of magic. Wizards through the ages have cataloged thousands of spells, grouping them into eight categories called schools. In some places, these traditions are literally schools. In other institutions, the schools are more like academic departments, with rival faculties competing for students and funding. Even wizards who train apprentices in the solitude of their own towers use the division of magic into schools as a learning device, since the spells of each school require mastery of different techniques.</p>\n<h2>School of Evocation</h2>\n<p>You focus your study on magic that creates powerful elemental effects such as bitter cold, searing flame, rolling thunder, crackling lightning, and burning acid. Some evokers find employment in military forces, serving as artillery to blast enemy armies from afar. Others use their spectacular power to protect the weak, while some seek their own gain as bandits, adventurers, or aspiring tyrants.</p>\n<h3>School of Evocation Features</h3>\n<p>2nd Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.7uzJ2JkmsdRGLra3]{Evocation Savant} @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.6VBXkjjBgjSpNElh]{Sculpt Spells}</p>\n<p>6th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.evEWCpE5MYgr5RRW]{Potent Cantrip}</p>\n<p>10th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.7O85kj6uDEG5NzUE]{Empowered Evocation}</p>\n<p>14th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.VUtSLeCzFubGXmGx]{Overchannel}</p>"

If you prepare the 1st-level spell magic missile, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p><p>You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest.

They hold themselves to the highest standards of conduct, and some, for better or worse, hold the rest of the world to the same standards. Many who swear this oath are devoted to gods of law and good and use their gods’ tenets as the measure of their devotion.

They age noticeably faster and rarely live longer than 75 years.</p><p><em><strong>Alignment.</strong></em> Half-­orcs inherit a tendency toward chaos from their orc parents and are not strongly inclined toward good. Half-­orcs raised among orcs and willing to live out their lives among them are usually evil.</p><p><em><strong>Size.</strong></em> Half-­orcs are somewhat larger and bulkier than humans, and they range from 5 to well over 6 feet tall. Your size is Medium.</p><p><em><strong>Speed.</strong></em> Your base walking speed is 30 feet.</p><p><em><strong>Darkvision.</strong></em> Thanks to your orc blood, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.</p><p><em><strong>Menacing.</strong></em> You gain proficiency in the Intimidation skill.</p><p><em><strong>Relentless Endurance.</strong></em> @Compendium[dnd5e.races.97c8i9Z28thvZuA8]{Relentless Endurance} When you are reduced to 0 hit points but not killed outright, you can drop to 1 hit point instead.
