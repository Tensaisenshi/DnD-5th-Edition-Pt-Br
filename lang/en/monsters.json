Atop the spider’s tiny head are eight glistening eyes with which it views the world in relative obscurity. While the spider’s eyesight may be poor regardless of the number of eyes, they have a clever trick up their sleeves: the spider’s web!</p>\n<p><strong>Some Bug.</strong> Ingenious little architects, spiders produce a silken thread from their rears dubbed “webbing” which they use to construct elaborate homes. Resembling something of a net, the spider’s web serves a dual purpose: to capture food upon its sticky surface and to give the spider a safe place to perch away from predators. Once an insect is trapped within the web, the spider quickly wraps the unsuspecting creature in a bundle of webbing, saving its prize for later consumption. While all spiders are venomous in some capacity, many will not be harmful to the adventurer on their travels. Simply avoid webs where you see them and be quite sure that the web which you see only belongs to a standard spider species, as a plethora of gigantic and magical varieties also lurk within similar webs!</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Token artwork by Forgotten Adventures.</em></li>\n<li><em>Bestiary entry by Penelope (Vyrnali).</em></li>\n</ul>",

These octopods resemble nothing more than a wet piece of bulbous taffy with eight sprawling tentacles slithering out of its central body. Upon this gelatinous body lie two observant eyes and were one to look underneath the creature they would find a sharpened bird-like beak ready to steal a probing finger away. Octopi are solely waterborne animals due to their inability to breathe air, though with effort they may remain upon land for very short durations. Sailors find pleasure in attempting to take these intelligent beasts for pets, only to find that the octopus has escaped whatever confines it was stored in time and time again. As long as an opening is as wide as its hard chitinous beak, the moldable octopus’ body will follow into inconceivably tight spaces.</p>\n<p>Many breeds of octopus also bear special pigmentation cells which expand and contract to change their body’s color. This provides the octopus with an advantage when hunting for its prey of fish and crabs as they can blend in almost seamlessly with the ocean floor or a bed of coral. Rather than outright fight (unless left with no choice) the octopus has the unique defense of spraying a cloud of ink from the underside of its body to blind its foes and make a speedy escape. Do consider the octopus as a worthy familiar form should you find yourself at sea for an extended time!</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Token artwork by Forgotten Adventures.</em></li>\n<li><em>Bestiary entry by Penelope (Vyrnali).</em></li>\n</ul>",

These hardy ruminant beasts ranging from four and a half to nearly seven feet in height and subsist primarily upon the leaves of the forest floor and plants of the plains. Deer present with noticeable sexual dimorphism; the males or “bucks” brandish large multi-pronged racks of antlers upon their heads which they shed and regrow annually. Female deer, or “does”, lack the antlers of their male counterparts but are no less hardy when it comes to defending their herds.</p>\n<p><strong>Oh Deer, oh Deer</strong>. Deer are commonly docile creatures who will often flee at the first sight of any humanoid wandering into their domain. However, should you be unfortunate enough to encounter a buck during their mating season, you should consider taking a different path. Male deer’s antlers can easily pierce weaker armor and flesh, tearing through a body as easily as a spear. Should you walk too close to a doe’s precious children (or fawns) you will most assuredly experience the taste of the mother’s hardened hooves upon you packing an uncanny amount of force for such nimble frames. Deer, when an adventurer’s survival is considered, are best hunted from a distance to avoid these vicious melee defenses. The deer’s meat, called “venison”, is mildly gamey though tasty and filling all the same, and the beasts’ hides can be used for warmth or shelter in times of great need.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Token artwork by Forgotten Adventures.</em></li>\n<li><em>Bestiary entry by Penelope (Vyrnali).</em></li>\n</ul>",

Next Kobold I see I'm turning to paste…\"<br>- Guard Captain Nathaniel Greenbow, interviewed for this bestiary.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Kobolds are conniving, cowardly humanoids of a reptilian appearance who infest the dungeons, catacombs, and caverns of our world. Appearing as tiny dragonoids with scaled flesh and crocodile-like snouts, Kobolds are perhaps more clever than their outward appearance would lead one to believe. Within their tiny heads (as the creatures stand no more than two and a half feet tall) lies a brain churning with myriad ideas, though many include idiotically dangerous schemes. It is not uncommon for many Kobolds to perish before their first complete decade of life.</p>\n<p><strong>Mob Mentality.</strong> Kobolds, much like rodents, breed at an astonishingly quick rate as compared to other humanoid species. Egg-layers like their draconic kin, Kobolds mature rapidly upon emerging from their shells, and assume their place within the ranks of their chittering society. Even upon reaching maturity, however, the Kobold is still a weak creature causing the colonies to stick together when exploring or hunting. Though Kobolds may defeat larger foes with sheer numbers, it is often at the cost of massive casualties on the Kobold's side. This, of course, hardly deters the resentful Kobolds, who have more eggs incubating away with the next infantry reinforcements just moments away from joining the fold.</p>\n<p><strong>Launch the Centipult.</strong> Stupid yet clever, Kobolds truly excel at two things: burrow-making and creating traps for unwary adventurers. Traps, of course, are the Kobold's speciality and they take relish in littering their lairs with copious defenses hewn from the natural resources of their home. Perhaps crushing logs were torn from the rafter struts of an abandoned temple, or carnivorous insects were placed into dropping ceramic pots to smash down upon foolish intruders. Never underestimate the ability of a Kobold to find some unsuspected way to impede your progress.</p>\n<p><strong>Trade Offs.</strong> Though strong in numbers, Kobolds may be defeated in several ways. Firstly, the creatures are born and mature within near total darkness, thus the sun weakens them and blinds their sensitive eyes. Kobolds are also nigh defenseless without the aid of their allies at their backs; often a lone Kobold with attempt to scurry away should they be caught out without their pack. Greedy and determined when it comes to self-preservation, Kobolds may be easily manipulated with smooth talk or a shiny trinket to line their pockets. Draconic in nature as well, the scuttling dragonoids can be used as crude translators of the dragon's tongue should you require such services on your journey.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Token artwork by Forgotten Adventures.</em></li>\n<li><em>Bestiary entry by Penelope (Vyrnali).</em></li>\n</ul>",

Crabs are uniquely robust little creatures often no larger than the palm of an adult human’s hand, with eight segmented legs protruding from either side of its scallop-shaped carapace. This hardened chitin carapace is topped with two black eye stalks (not unlike those of a snail) through which the beast views our coastlines and oceans. It has been observed that some species of crab lack an armored shell and prefer to squat in the discarded shells of conchs. This gives the crab a rather clever and sturdy mobile home. Adorning the crabs ninth and tenth appendages near its tiny mouth are two massive claws, resembling those of a scorpion, with dull serrations marking the inner edge of each. The crab primarily utilizes these claws in its search for food, cracking open the shells of other tiny aquatic beasts or snipping off tiny pieces of undersea plant life to dine on.</p>\n<p>While perhaps not the most dangerous companion a summoner could wish for, the crab’s ability to breath both in the water and upon land makes the crustacean an ally brimming with utility. I advise caution, however, when first looking through your crab familiar’s eyes, as the sideways scuttling by which the crab moves has proven to cause vomiting in some weak stomached summoners.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Token artwork by Forgotten Adventures.</em></li>\n<li><em>Bestiary entry by Penelope (Vyrnali).</em></li>\n</ul>",

I swear it's true!!!\"</p>\n<p>- Unknown Disorderly Patron at the Brass Buck Tavern.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<section class=\"secret\">\n<p>What more could be said about the humble crab than is not already common knowledge to those who live near or frequent the coasts of the continent. Crabs are uniquely robust little creatures often no larger than the palm of an adult human's hand, with eight segmented legs protruding from either side of its scallop-shaped carapace. This hardened chitin carapace is topped with two black eye stalks (not unlike those of a snail) through which the beast views our coastlines and oceans. It has been observed that some species of crab lack an armored shell and prefer to squat in the discarded shells of conchs. This gives the crab a rather clever and sturdy mobile home. Adorning the crabs ninth and tenth appendages near its tiny mouth are two massive claws, resembling those of a scorpion, with dull serrations marking the inner edge of each. The crab primarily utilizes these claws in its search for food, cracking open the shells of other tiny aquatic beasts or snipping off tiny pieces of undersea plant life to dine on.</p>\n</section>\n<p>While perhaps not the most dangerous companion a summoner could wish for, the crab's ability to breath both in the water and upon land makes the crustacean an ally brimming with utility. I advise caution, however, when first looking through your crab familiar's eyes, as the sideways scuttling by which the crab moves has proven to cause vomiting in some weak stomached summoners.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Token artwork by Forgotten Adventures.</em></li>\n<li><em>Bestiary entry by Penelope (Vyrnali).</em></li>\n</ul>",

Perhaps you tried to scry an enemy’s sanctum⁠ but instead viewed an illusion⁠, or you are attempting to teleport to a familiar location that no longer exists.</p>\n<p><strong>On Target</strong>. You and your group (or the target object) appear where you want to.</p>\n<p><strong>Off Target</strong>. You and your group (or the target object) appear a random distance away from the destination in a random direction. Distance off target is 1d10 × 1d10 percent of the distance that was to be traveled. For example, if you tried to travel 120 miles, landed off target, and rolled a 5 and 3 on the two d10s, then you would be off target by 15 percent, or 18 miles. The DM determines the direction off target randomly by rolling a d8 and designating 1 as north, 2 as northeast, 3 as east, and so on around the points of the compass. If you were teleporting to a coastal city and wound up 18 miles out at sea, you could be in trouble.</p>\n<p><strong>Similar Area</strong>. You and your group (or the target object) wind up in a different area that’s visually or thematically similar to the target area. If you are heading for your home laboratory, for example, you might wind up in another wizard’s laboratory or in an alchemical supply shop that has many of the same tools and implements as your laboratory. Generally, you appear in the closest similar place, but since the spell has no range limit, you could conceivably wind up anywhere on the plane.</p>\n<p><strong>Mishap</strong>. The spell’s unpredictable magic results in a difficult journey. Each teleporting creature (or the target object) takes 3d10 <em>force damage</em>, and the DM rerolls on the table to see where you wind up (multiple mishaps can occur, dealing damage each time).</p>"

I strayed from my mentor, a priest in his middle years with a soft voice and ring of grey-dappled hair about a balding head, to approach a statue set aside within a shadowed alcove.&nbsp; It depicted our god in his humanoid form, an elderly man standing strictly at attention, his wild hair hanging as long as his chest length beard, a staff topped with a stern faced sun clutched in his hand.&nbsp; I knelt, still only fourteen, before this statue and began to pray right then.&nbsp; The next six years of my acolyte training would be nothing but a blessing, I knew.&nbsp;<br><em>“The Gleaming Star”, by Bishop Bernard Portis.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Acolytes are those devoted followers of a particular goddess or god who have decided to take on the mantle of the clergy to better serve their chosen deity.&nbsp; Often no older than teenagers (though some acolytes begin later in their lives) acolytes are trained for a number of years (typically between three to ten) depending on the strictures of their deity’s doctrines.&nbsp; During their time they memorize and study all written materials concerning their deity and their teachings, learn magics (be they healing or harmful) gifted to the acolytes by their deities, and often go out into their community to provide aid to those in need or proselytize the words of their goddess or god.&nbsp; Though not every acolyte climbs the ranks into full fledged priesthood, many remain highly dedicated to the church and remain to serve as life-long acolytes working closely with the lay community outside the temple walls.</p>\n<p>Recall that acolytes are trained in the arcane ways of their chosen deities.&nbsp; This being the case, acolytes rarely receive sufficient martial training in comparison to the paladin ranks of the temple (unless expressly dictated otherwise by their deity’s teachings).&nbsp; This being the case, the acolyte is able to unleash some basic divine magic in order to both defend themselves and allies or to call upon their patron deity for aid for injured parties.&nbsp; Typically expelled in a gleaming shower of golden sparks and dazzlingly vibrant lights, the magic of the gods is truly something special, even at such a base nature.&nbsp; Spells such as Cure Wounds, Sacred Flame, or Sanctuary are all practiced by acolytes early on into their divine studies.&nbsp; Acolytes can make handy allies should you be in need of divine protection or a field medic for an injured compatriot.&nbsp; Be sure to mind your acolyte well, however, as their spellwork can easily be interrupted if they are forced into a melee fight with a band of slavering gnolls.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Token artwork by Forgotten Adventures.</em></li>\n<li><em>Bestiary entry by Penelope (Vyrnali).</em></li>\n</ul>",

      "description": "<p>Snakes rank among the most plentiful and diverse reptiles to slither across our planet's surface. Resembling nothing more than a scaly worm at first look, snakes are actually highly developed predators who slither across the ground in order to stealthily hunt their prey of smaller reptiles, rodents, and birds. Though there are many species of snake, we will only discuss the poisonous varieties within this article. Poisonous snakes bear a marked identifier separating them from their nonpoisonous brethren: the shape of their pupils. While snakes lacking venom glands have rounded pupils, those snakes with a venomous bite have slitted pupils much like those of a common domestic cat. The devious snake, however, has so much more beneath its scaly surface.</p>\n<p><strong>Don't Tread on Me.</strong> Ever camouflaged both by their similarities to roots, sticks, or branches as well as the marvelous patterns of black, browns, greens, and tans speckling their hides, snakes are masters of blending into their surroundings. Even perched on a rock to warm their bodies in the heat of the sun, snakes can certainly be missed by just a passing glance. While the creature's eyesight is relatively poor, snakes have adapted an amazing ability to sense the world around them. Snakes \"smell\" with their tongues! Yes, by flicking their tongues out of their mouths with a fascinating flourish, these reptiles are able to smell prey or predators in their environment by collecting the miniscule scents on their tongues. Within the snake's mouth lies its most deadly asset in the form of two, hollow fangs. Snakes prefer to strike from the shadows, allowing their quiet method of travel to get them close enough to their prey to avoid a fight. The creature then lashes out in the blink of an eye, catching the unwary prey in their jaws while injecting them with a controlled dose of highly toxic venom through their hollow fangs. Then it's only a matter of moments until the poor creature is left dead by the snake's potent toxins. While the majority of snake species are not deadly to humanoids, caution is advised for those not well versed in identifying reptiles. Antidote should always be carried in areas known to house populations of poisonous snakes, just in case.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Token artwork by Forgotten Adventures.</em></li>\n<li><em>Bestiary entry by Penelope (Vyrnali).</em></li>\n</ul>",

Dwellers of the coastal urban sprawl see the armored law keepers near daily as they patrol the streets, guard our gates, inspect shipments, and of course assist (or arrest) those citizens of their fair cities. However, the guard is not only bound by the gates and ramparts of a city's walls. Be they mercenary or professional, guards are often found patrolling the roads, either to sweep away stray packs of animals or bandits, or on alert to protect precious cargo or important citizens as they travel the less settled areas of the world. Much like the bandits and cultists who we have previously discussed in this tome, guards come in all varieties. Though many may seem to be highly trained and regimented, it should be considered that most guards see no more action than a tussle on the busy streets of a market or scattering a few bandit scavengers from an upturned wagon. Guards are not all the hardened and grizzled ex-military types we think of at the upper ranks of the orders. Be observant, young adventurer, and heed the warnings of the law, for while the guards may only be a minor threat to your dastardly visions, what lays in wait in the city dungeon may not be worth the risks!</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Token artwork by Forgotten Adventures.</em></li>\n<li><em>Bestiary entry by Penelope (Vyrnali).</em></li>\n</ul>",

      "description": "<p>A proud scream from on high, a blur of feathers, and the sharp embrace of long, needle sharp talons upon your flesh mark that you may have angered this raptor: the Eagle. Eagles are noble birds who traverse the skies of our woodlands and mountains in search of fatty fish, rodents, or reptiles to keep them well-fed. Eagles have wingspans as tall as any humanoid, often reaching upwards of six and a half to seven feet long! It is with these powerful wings and their keen vision that an eagle can surprise its prey from soaring heights, giving the avian the element of surprise on unsuspecting prey. I myself have witnessed an eagle swoop down from on high and scoop up a noble woman’s small pet terrier, wrenching the yowling canine from the lady’s grasp before fading away into the afternoon skies. Truly these birds are powerful specimens!</p>\n<p><strong>Touch the Sky.</strong> The eagle prefers solitude when it can find it. The birds nest in homemade eyries, or nests, high above the world on mountain cliff faces. Here in the eyrie, the eagles lay their clutch of two eggs and raise a tiny, insular family with the female (and often much larger) chick taking dominance over any male born into the clan. The chicks grow under the care of their parents, being fed on a diet of regurgitated food until they are large enough to learn how to fly on their own. At this point, baby eagles are shunned from the nest and forced out into the world to fend for themselves.</p>\n<p><strong>Lone Ranger.</strong> Eagles make fine companions for those who understand that these birds of prey are no mere pet, but an equal ally in their adventurers. Rangers seem particularly fond of the eagle as a hunting partner, as the birds may roam far and wide during a hunt and bring their master back any spoils they’ve found on their quest. This specialized form of modern falconry utilizes the eagles as trackers as well, as the eagle may spot prey from a great distance, then return to their master and guide them towards the quarry. Should you be adventuring out into the world and have the patience for such a companion, perhaps consider the eagle as a recommended choice for seasoned hunters.</p>",

      "description": "<p>Frogs are the most common amphibian to inhabit our planet. Frogs live a primary amount of their lives in and around sources of water which makes them common to swamps, marshes, and bogs. This, of course, is necessary as without a nearby source of water the frog’s slick skin would dry out and kill the frog. Insect eaters by nature, the frog utilizes its long, sticky tongue to capture all manner of insects (Author’s Note: In the swamps of the south, eye witnesses have sworn to have seen a frog species large enough that they ate small birds plucked right from the air!). Frogs have a unique manner of locomotion as their hind legs are far longer and folded in comparison to their front appendages. This unique evolution allows the frog to hop about and make quite fantastic jumps when fully extending its hind legs.</p>\n<p><strong>Tadpole evolved into Frog.</strong> Frogs begin their lives as nothing more than a jelly-like egg the size of a pinky nail. Upon hatching, the tiny frogs now in their tadpole state resemble miniature living comets, being hardly more than a ovular head and long swishing tail to propel themselves through the water. Over the course of several weeks the baby frogs develop limbs and fully evolve into their more recognizable adult form. Truly a fascinating process of development most often seen in insect species that our researchers have dubbed “metamorphosis”. What other creatures of our ever changing world could possess such a fantastic transformation as the common frog?</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Token artwork by Forgotten Adventures.</em></li>\n<li><em>Bestiary entry by Penelope (Vyrnali).</em></li>\n</ul>",

Known the world over for their large back humps (varying in number between one or two humps depending on species), camels have become an integral part of desert life due to their rugged albeit stubborn nature, nutritious meat and milk, and transportation utility. Camels have been domesticated for millennia. Highly sought after for their ability to survive within the harshest of deserts, the earliest records of camels in our world show them as domestic pack animals (much as they are utilized today) carrying heavy cargo across sandy expanses of inhospitable desert. The noble camel, however, may hold more secrets than its surface reveals.</p>\n<p><strong>Watch Out, They Spit.</strong> When asking a commoner about the camel’s most unique feature they will undoubtedly tell you that it is the fleshy humps upon the camel’s tall back. Commonly, these humps were thought to hold a reservoir of fresh water so the camel may survive the sandy dunes of its homeland; this is, however, not the case at all. Dissection of the dromedary beast has shown researchers that these humps are actually composed of fatty tissue which have collected into the humps as to not overheat the beast by being spread across the body. Camels, in fact, need only drink once every ten-day as their insulated coat keeps them at an adequate temperature and they absorb sufficient water vapor through exhaling via the nostrils. Camels also have a leathery mouth-lining allowing the herbivores to chew and swallow even the thorniest of cacti should they require water in such a fashion. Should you be in the desert and in need of a sturdy beast, adventurer, why not invest your gold into the camel? Just be mindful, they enjoy spitting on those they do not trust!</p>",

Nobles can run the gamut of humanoid races, so long as these folks have the wealth to back up their claim to a noble title. Not all nobles are born into wealth however; in rare cases nobles may earn their status by dedicated work to the lords of their regions or by simply having titles given to them via friends finding themselves in positions of power. Through all of the perfume and powders adorning a noble's body, no stink is so ever present as that of corruption wafting just below the flowery mask.</p>\n<p><strong>Entourage.</strong> Nobles rarely travel alone outside of their massive estates, prefering to be flanked by a retinue of trained bodyguards and faithful servants. This should always be kept in mind when dealing with nobles; there is never simply the nobleman/woman alone beyond their estate walls. Should a brigand be fearsome enough to make it through the noble's well-paid defenses, the monied elite is certainly a force to be reckoned with. Noble-birthed children receive some of the finest martial training in the land from an early age and are well equipped to strike back with sword or rapier. Keep an eye on your own footwork should you misstep and leave yourself open to a noble's well practiced parry. Be mindful of whom you may approach in a fight, as a noble has so much more to offer than their warm blood spilt carelessly upon the earth.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Token artwork by Forgotten Adventures.</em></li>\n<li><em>Bestiary entry by Penelope (Vyrnali).</em></li>\n</ul>",

These four legged friends are of course familiar to all whom read this tome and can come in thousands of various breeds and sizes. What makes these little reptiles so very unique (and possibly a fine form for your familiar) is their ability to cling to a multitude of surfaces. Adept at climbing, lizards may scale sheer surfaces and procure hidden vantage points from which to gaze down upon those you may wish to observe. Some varieties of lizards are also able to shift the pigmentation of their flesh, allowing for further subterfuge options! However, the humble lizard does not provide much in the way of offense as their bite is nothing more than a nuisance to most humanoids. The lizard is perhaps best left to the shadows, where it may observe the world unseen for its clever master.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Token artwork by Forgotten Adventures.</em></li>\n<li><em>Bestiary entry by Penelope (Vyrnali).</em></li>\n</ul>",

Hidden within their dog-like muzzles are deadly sharp canines and behind their eyes is a shockingly intelligent mind.</p>\n<p><strong>Tooth Troop.</strong> Baboons are at their strongest when surrounded by their troop where they employ simplistic pack tactics to take down their foes. The monkeys have been observed skulking through tall grasses to set an ambush for unsuspecting prey or banding together to single out and mercilessly maul specific targets before moving to the next. Troops are governed by a single alpha who acts as the primary guardian of their fellows. Beneath the alpha, the troop works collaboratively, sharing food and resources between each other and engaging in communal grooming sessions to strengthen their bonds. Baboon young are raised in small family groups, being instructed by multiple adults at a time. A truly fascinating community and unique to our animal kingdom, baboons should be given a wide berth and travelers should cautiously handle an unexpected meeting by a local troop should your paths cross.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Token artwork by Forgotten Adventures.</em></li>\n<li><em>Bestiary entry by Penelope (Vyrnali).</em></li>\n</ul>",

Though many modern researchers do not abide by this tale, it is rumored that Merfolk evolved from a colony of humans whose city sank below the waves in a catastrophic accident. The Merfolk themselves, however, choose neither to confirm or deny this tale. Very basically, Merfolk resemble an average humanoid with a few key differences. Where one would expect to find legs beneath the torso of a human, they would instead find the powerful tail of a relatively sized fish. Merfolk also have frilled gills adorning their necks allowing them to breathe the salty waters of the ocean's depths. Several additional fins grace the Merfolk's lithe body about the biceps and hips. Upon the Merfolk's humanoid head rests a single, large frill webbed by translucent skin which may raise or fold back depending on the Merfolk's mood.</p>\n<p><strong>Murmaider.</strong> Merfolk live along the coastal waters of continental shelves, rarely allowing themselves to drift down into the darker depths of the ocean's abyss. Here in the more shallow tides, the Merfolk build their homes into thriving coral reefs, labyrinthian undersea caverns, and even the hollowed out remains of once coastal cities or sunken vessels. Anywhere shrouded from the view of prying land-dwellers makes the perfect home for a Merfolk. The Merfolk's reclusiveness is so well known, that mariners would tell fanciful tales of meeting a Merfolk for a midnight tryst, only to be abandoned at sunrise by the elusive creature. Most of the mariner's fellows would shove the notion aside, having never seen a living or dead Merfolk in all their years at sea. This is not to say that Merfolk will flee from intruders should an unfortunate landlubber find their way into a Merfolk's abode. Armed with spears of sharpened coral and powerful webbed hands ending in dagger-like barbs the Merfolk are well equipped to defend themselves within their aquatic homes. Take care on the open seas, adventurer, and never run afoul of the Merfolk.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Token artwork by Forgotten Adventures.</em></li>\n<li><em>Bestiary entry by Penelope (Vyrnali).</em></li>\n</ul>",

However, something truly special lurks behind the dark abyss of this bird’s eyes. Should you be prepared, adventurer, the effort put into training the raven will be given back tenfold.</p>\n<p><strong>Musings and Mimicry.</strong> Ravens are unique specimens among birds; by listening intently and practicing often the raven is able to mimic sounds it hears perfectly. From noises of forest animals to the precise timbre of their master’s call, ravens are among the most seamless mimics to be found in the animal kingdom. Truly adventurer, the possibilities to employ the raven’s mimicry are nearly limitless! You may see another example of this perfect mimicry in a larger cousin to this bird as well: the humanoid Kenku. Raven-like in form these little humanoids share the feathers and large beaks of their brethren, as well as their ability to copy the sounds of the world around them.

Jackals are closely related to coyotes, the two species commonly hunt and travel through similar territories causing confusion among untrained researchers. Often a bright golden to light beige tone, the jackal’s fur is marked with notable black stirpes which run horizontally in thick bands across the beasts’ bodies. Jackals have a unique social structure among canids as they most often shirk life with a pack in favor of finding a singular, monogamous mate with whom they remain in a wide territory. This is not to say that some jackals do not form packs; however, it will be more common in your travels to spot a bachelor or breeding pair rather than a whole cluster of these beasts. Much like the savannah’s hyenas, the jackal does not escape the skeptical eye of the trained adventurer as the warning sign of evil upon the horizon. Gifted sentience and the ability of shape-changing by the Demon Lord Graz’zt, newly created beasts dubbed Jackalweres resemble humanoid jackals in their hybrid forms. Now bound to the Demon Lord, the Jackalwere assumes the life of a slaver, plucking unsuspecting humanoids from their comfortable lives by rendering them helpless under the Jackalwere’s magical, sleep inducing gaze. Beware young adventurers, for the small jackal you see feasting upon carrion by the road’s edge may be the servant of a demonic overlord in magical disguise.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Token artwork by Forgotten Adventures.</em></li>\n<li><em>Bestiary entry by Penelope (Vyrnali).</em></li>\n</ul>",

Thus, ponies are simply nothing more than small horses. Ponies often make treasured gifts to the children of upper class society as they are prized for their beauty and calm demeanor. Ponies are also used by the small folk of the realm in a way very similar to how a human would utilize a full-sized horse.

Commoners may be intelligent or foolish, mighty or cowardly; certainly a commoner should be admired for their uniqueness in our world.

This is not to say, however, that even a single commoner (though more often mob mentality rules) can rise up and begin a stunning brawl of their own. Beware, adventurers, for even a seemingly simple commoner can fight dirty and surprise a seasoned fighter. However, a majority of commoners are less skilled in the martial arts, so do not be surprised if they reach for uncommon weapons to defend themselves including: clubs, broken bottles, chairs, barrels, stones, and cookware.

Beware the ass-end of this quiet creature, however, as mules have a mighty kick which they can deliver at force behind themselves much like a horse.

These tiny, docile titans content themselves in scuttling through darkened places such as caverns, catacombs, and mossy overgrowths in search of scraps to eat or a quiet, damp place in which to make their burrows.</p>\n<p><strong>Of Darkness and Light.</strong> Curiously enough, due to the species evolving without the natural light of our sun, the poor creature is completely blind. The Giant Fire Beetle, however, is not totally without senses. Using specialized antenna, these hardy insects are able to “see” the world around them within a slightly limited ranged. The true prize (as so many fledgling adventurers boast) is the orange bioluminescent glands located beneath either side of their mandibles and to the very rear of their abdomen. These firey hued glands are packed with a symbiotic, glowing fungus, which will continue to glow for up to one week once disconnected from their host! Some clever adventurers have taken to capturing live beetles, placing them within empty lanterns to light their way in remote caverns for even longer periods of time.</p>\n<p><strong>In Last Resort.</strong> Most often a peaceful insect, Giant Fire Beetles have been observed defending food in times of great hunger; the creatures will rarely flee a tasty morsel should they feel a threat to their meal is near. The Giant Fire Beetle does pack a nasty bite with its sharpened mandibles that may pierce even the toughest boiled leather armor should it feel threatened enough to attack. Take heed when approaching a swarm of these insects lest you suffer some nasty lacerations. Older texts on the nature of beasts do speak of a breed of Giant Fire Beetle that excreted a combustible fluid and ignited the mixture causing severe burns to the unwary. This has never been scientifically proven, but new discoveries happen each day!</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Token artwork by Forgotten Adventures.</em></li>\n<li><em>Bestiary entry by Penelope (Vyrnali).</em></li>\n</ul>",

Next, mold a simple poppet of your desired servant out of wet clay pulled from a local source and place the poppet into the center of your circle making sure it sits upright. Employing the use of a tool, grate your mandrake root into a fine powder and sprinkle the root mixed with both the ashes of your hearth and blood drawn fresh from your body around the runic circle rotating in a counterclockwise motion. With this completed, place your hand within the circle and speak your servant’s chosen name to command it into life. Should you follow these instructions to the letter, your homunculus will spring to life in an instant.”<br><em>- Copied from a faded page of Minions and the Menial: Your Guide to Magical Companions.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Alchemical Aids.</strong> A homunculus is a manner of minor construct not uncommon to mages and artificers. These squirrel sized companions are molded out of wads of clay and given life through a rare ritual taught to more experienced spellcasters. The homunculi have the extraordinary ability to experience the thoughts and senses of their master as the two share a special telepathic bond that may only be broken in death of if one of the parties ventures to a separate plane of existence. The homunculus is also gifted a language upon awakening and may act as a servant, spy, or even simple messenger for their master. It is not at all uncommon to see those in possession of a homunculus to utilize them in completing simple chores about their abodes so the spellcaster may focus on more tedious tasks. An odd caveat of this homunculus ritual is that the spellcaster may only be in possession of one clay companion at a time; should the caster attempt to create a new homunculus the process with always fail. Unless the creature or spellcaster dies, it will remain at the caster’s side as a loyal companion for the whole of their life.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Token artwork by Forgotten Adventures.</em></li>\n<li><em>Bestiary entry by Penelope (Vyrnali).</em></li>\n</ul>",

Hyenas resemble a medium sized dog with a short, wide muzzle and overly long neck. Adorned with patterns of spots or stripes marking their fur, to the untrained eyes a hyena would appear to be nothing more than a wild dog; however, these curious creatures are more closely related to wildcats in their behavior with fellows. Hyenas communally groom unlike several wild dog species and display similar scent marking and mating patterns as other feliforms. These sorts of behaviors build a solid community within the hyenas’ pack, sowing tight knit bonds between the beasts.</p>\n<p><strong>Give Us a Smile.</strong> Hyenas display a unique characteristic in their vocalizations between the pack; instead of a yowl or bark as one would expect, the hyenas instead communicate via yips, chirps, and “laughs”. Each member of the pack has its own unique “laugh” which signals to the pack both their identity and current mood. These chittering “laughs” have given the hyena (regardless of species to commoners) the moniker of The Laughing Hyena. One should instead feel caution over joy should you hear the caterwauling yips of a hyena pack in the distance. These beasts are highly intelligent and when banded together and utilizing their preferred hunting patterns they may easily overtake a large mercantile caravan.</p>\n<p><strong>The Hungering Savagery.</strong> The hyena’s most sinister aspect is their relation to the Demon Lord of the Gnolls, Yeenoghu. Gnolls, of course, resemble massive humanoid hyenas brandishing bloody weapons and sowing destruction in their horrid wakes. Finding the hyena either useful or ironic, Gnolls will bring packs of slavering hyenas with them on raids into villages or leave the beasts (which they purposefully starve) at their dens to kill any unwary explorers. Adventurers should be observant when investigating the happenings of hyenas in an area, as if the beasts seem more ravenous than expected it may be that Yeenoghu’s minions are not far behind.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Token artwork by Forgotten Adventures.</em></li>\n<li><em>Bestiary entry by Penelope (Vyrnali).</em></li>\n</ul>",

Owls are medium-sized birds of prey with flat, disk shaped faces and large dark eyes. A sharp beak sits at the center of their ovular face, built for tearing the flesh of small rodents. As deadly as they are silent, owls are nocturnal beasts who hunt from the shadows of treetops, barn lofts, or simply high above in an open field. Owls are able to fly in near silence due to a set of specialized feathers along their wing-tops, giving them the ability to glide down and surprise an unsuspecting vole without ever being heard. Owls are not the most sociable creatures, preferring to keep to their roosts in solitude making them treasured by arcanists as the bird primarily sits quietly throughout the day, lost in sleep. Owls also have a unique vocalization among birds, emitting a mournful hoot-hoot sound rather than the typical songbird tweeting. Perhaps consider the owl should you be uninterested in sociable animals or if you wish to send messages in relative secrecy in the dead of night.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Token artwork by Forgotten Adventures.</em></li>\n<li><em>Bestiary entry by Penelope (Vyrnali).</em></li>\n</ul>",

The vulture’s outer appearance along with its penchant to scavenge carrion for sustenance has settled the bird squarely into the designation of “evil” in the eyes of many common-folk. The bird’s connection with death, as the vulture will circle a dead or dying creature from high above, also adds to the revulsion felt towards this markedly important creature.</p>\n<p><strong>By Committee.</strong> Vultures congregate in groups called “committees” or “wakes” on whether or not they are feasting together respectively. These groups squabble for scraps of meat, ripping away rotting flesh from a carcass with their sharp and powerful beaks. It is not uncommon for fights to break out between the hungry birds. Due to their desire to scavenge dead flesh, vultures play a vital role in our ecosystem, as they act as vital decomposers in landscapes where insects or fungi may not exist as readily.

Several species of these birds of prey have been observed employing different tactics in their hunting patterns as well; while the mighty eagle soars down from on high and lifts its prey off into the air with it, hawks prefer to lurk in the cover of trees, waiting for the opportune time to swoop in and surprise their prey from the shadows. Due to their keen eyesight as well as their smaller profile, hawks have been utilized as messenger birds by desert cultures for centuries.

Stirges resemble nothing more than a slightly oversized bat crossed with a mosquito; however, upon closer inspection the Stirge reveals much more. Coated in greasy, pink flesh (save for a small tufted mane of white fur about its head and neck) the Stirge is equipped with a pair of small, bat-like wings made of stretched flesh between struts of thin bone. The skin here at the wing is so thin that light may easily shine through the beast's wings revealing the tiny vesicles within. Stirges also possess a set of six, spindly legs above their pig-like tail. Each leg is tipped with a set of hooked claws which allows the fiend to grip into the flesh of its prey and hang on should a struggle ensue. However, there is one more feature that makes the Stirge truly repugnant.</p>\n<p><strong>What's Your Type?</strong> Stirges are notable for their ravenous desire to consume the blood of living organisms. These beasts accomplish this foul act with aid from the needle-sharp proboscis waiting at the end of its oversized snout. Gifted with the ability of flight, the Stirge dives down upon an unsuspecting enemy and clamps onto their body with the aid of their barbed claws. The Stirge then drives its proboscis into their victim's flesh, sucking out ounce after ounce of warm blood. Only when the Stirge is sufficiently sated (or battered away) will it release its victim to flee into the darkness where it may digest its liquid lunch. Act fast if Stirges are in the area, lest a swarm of them suck you dry before you have time to react.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Token artwork by Forgotten Adventures.</em></li>\n<li><em>Bestiary entry by Penelope (Vyrnali).</em></li>\n</ul>",

These formerly average forest plants are gifted with mild sentience by the natural spellwork of a most-powerful druid who has cast the Awaken spell to birth an Awakened Shrub.</p>\n<p>The shrub itself, having negligible will of its own, then remains @JournalEntry[Charmed] to the spellcaster for thirty days, during which, the Awakened Shrub serves at the whim of the druid. The leafy automaton is also given the ability to move independently by the spellwork cast upon it.

A unique feature of the Awakened Shrub is its indistinguishability between itself and an average shrub when it stands completely still. The ability to camouflage themselves so thoroughly allows the Awakened Shrubs to act as sentires for a more secretive druid’s hideaway.</p>\n<p>As recommended to me by a friend of the forest: be advised to utilize the shrubs in small groups as to simply overwhelm any nosey intruders. Strength in numbers is key for these simplistic shrubs as they may be easily dispatched if singled out. As the magic within the shrub allows the shrubs to speak a language known to their creator, Awakened Shrubs may also be programmed with a warning message and avoid conflict altogether. The shrubs, however, are quite inept when it comes to the completion of even the most simplistic tasks, so utilizing them in a “living alarm” capacity may be the wisest choice.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Token artwork by Forgotten Adventures.</em></li>\n<li><em>Bestiary entry by Penelope (Vyrnali).</em></li>\n</ul>",

The cat proves time and time again to be a prized companion whether they are keeping your property free of unwanted pests or cuddling up upon their master’s lap for a cozy night within the study. Found in a number of varieties from the pure black short-haired cats associated with ill omens to the fluffy coated and absurdly flat-faced cats of the frozen north, there appears to be limitless breeds to select from. (Author’s Note: I have recently heard rumor of a cat which produces no hair, requiring its master to simply stroke its flesh without pleasant barriers. More evidence forthcoming of this unfounded discovery). However, our feline compatriots have much more to offer when looked at under the shrewd eye of the adventurer!</p>\n<p><strong>Purrfect Pals.</strong> Be it at the side of the elder potion-maker tucked safely away in their shop or out with the upstart young ranger braving the rolling fields of the hinterlands, cats are found dotted all across our marvelous land. Compact and light in weight, these agile little hunters fit perfectly atop one’s shoulder or nestled within a wagon’s goods. Cats provide useful utility to the crafty conjurer who binds their familiar to such a form as well; with honed claws able to retract in a lighting’s flash back into their paws the cat makes for a deadly hunter against smaller beasts. Cats also have a flexible spine allowing them to squeeze into difficult to reach places should you coax them adequately or even survive a perilous fall. Researchers have discovered that cats seem to have the uncanny ability to land upon their feet regardless of the angle at which they are dropped; surely this is an astonishing advantage over other less agile creatures! Deathly quiet (unless they prefer to pester their master for tasty morsels with a noisome yowl) a cat is an adequate infiltrator should one prefer to observe their surroundings from a safer distance through this familiar’s eyes. Be they conjured or corporeal, it is this author’s opinion that the common cat is a companion of quality and should be considered when seeking the appropriate animal ally.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Token artwork by Forgotten Adventures.</em></li>\n<li><em>Bestiary entry by Penelope (Vyrnali).</em></li>\n</ul>",

Two rubbery tentacles end in spiky, leaf-like appendages that the otyugh uses to shovel food into its gaping maw. An otyugh buries itself under mounds of offal and carrion, leaving only its sensory stalk exposed. When an edible creature happens by, the otyugh's tentacles erupt from the filth and grab hold of it. Otyughs make the most of any opportunity to ambush and devour prey. They use a limited form of telepathy to urge sentient creatures toward their lairs, sometimes by pretending to be something else.</p>\n<p><strong>Dwellers in Darkness.</strong> Otyughs tolerate bright light only when considerable stores of carrion or garbage lie within reach. In the wilderness, they dwell in stagnant swamps, scum-filled ponds, and damp forest dells.

Since otyughs lack concern for anything but food, their nests sometimes accumulate a variety of treasures shed from their victims and mixed among the junk.</p>\n<p><strong>Symbiotic Guardians.</strong> Sentient subterranean beings can coexist with otyughs, employing them as garbage disposals. With such plentiful sustenance, otyughs grow fat in their wallows, unmoved by any other drive or desire. This sedentary gluttony makes them reliable guardians. As long as it is fed, an otyugh refrains from attacking other creatures. However, would-be otyugh masters can easily underestimate the quantity of waste, carrion, and meat necessary to keep an otyugh from wandering off in search of food.

Here we will view the commonalities of what would be considered the “bandit” class of criminal. Be advised while reviewing this information that not all bandits should be viewed with a scornful eye. While many seek harm or riches from their quarry, others thieve to survive in a world most unfair.</p>\n<p><strong>The Good.</strong> We begin with those bandits who could be seen as “noble criminals”. These bandits consist of the most downtrodden of our nations, those citizens who have struggled through poverty and oppression to scrape out a meager existence clinging to any comfort they can grasp. Consider what would drive a person to commit something so desperate as robbery or open theft in a village street. Bandits of a nobler sort may still be selfish with their earnings, taking what they have stolen to enrich their own lives or those of immediate relations. There are some bandits, however, who seek to use their pilfered goods to improve the lives of the poorer community. Be aware that often these bandits are desperate and afraid, especially during the act of robbery. They are scared, driven to crime by poor circumstances, so they may not require violence to disperse as more often than not they will not physically harm their victims. Keep an open mind as you travel through the world young adventurer and remember that were the tables turned, you may wish for mercy for such a minor infraction.</p>\n<p><strong>The Bad and Ugly.</strong> For every good-hearted soul stealing from those with too much and giving to the unfortunate, there is a truly villainous spirit lurking behind the brush of a nearby road, lying in wait for an unsuspecting victim. During your travels, adventurer, these sorts may be the most common instances of banditry you will experience. Armed with swords, clubs, and bows, the more nefarious of the bandit world prefer to ambush their prey from the shadows of hills and trees, catching traveling parties unaware. These treacherous thieves will attempt diversion and trickery in order to catch their quarry off guard should their crew be outnumbered. Bandits have no boundaries of borders or locale, so caution should be taken whether you walk upon a forested road or sail the high seas as you island hop for fame. Danger lurks in every corner of our world adventurer, be prepared and discerning should you encounter a party of brigands lest your career end well before your legend is written.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Token artwork by Forgotten Adventures.</em></li>\n<li><em>Bestiary entry by Penelope (Vyrnali).</em></li>\n</ul>",

Tribal warriors act not like the guards of the city gates; rather, they function on hierarchies of honor, physical prowess, and in the legacy of deeds won in battle. Equipped with simple weapons such as spears, shortswords, or blunt maces the tribal warrior thrives within the heat of a battle, relishing in the decimation of their enemies. Theirs is a world of power struggles played upon the field of war rather than behind the closed doors of a council chamber. While one on one fights may be availed to combatants who prove themselves a worthy challenge, the tribal warrior is often not far from their allies. Utilizing simple combat techniques to pincer or route adversaries, the tribal warrior is no stranger to guerilla combat. Should you enter a tribe's hard won territory it will be likely that the tribe was alerted miles ahead of your approach to their borders. Be cautious, be wise, and keep an eye upon the rustling trees of the roadways should you stray into a land most unfamiliar. Tribal warriors respect honor and might, should you show them both then bloodshed of a greater order may be quickly avoided.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Token artwork by Forgotten Adventures.</em></li>\n<li><em>Bestiary entry by Penelope (Vyrnali).</em></li>\n</ul>",

Approximately the size of an adult human’s fist, these tiny beasts are ravenous when they sense any scrap of food is nearby. The quipper’s jaw is lined with a jagged row of dagger-sharp teeth which they use to strip flesh from bones at lightning speed. The quipper’s ability to see even within the darkness of a frigid cavern lake makes them extremely deadly to the unwary traveler who takes an accidental plunge into the darkened waters. Though it is not entirely unheard of to see quippers on their own it is far more common that they travel in swirling swarms. These clouds of razor-toothed fish can sense blood in the water from great distances, able to sniff a single drop of the life giving fluid in over 200 liters of water. I suggest that any adventurer steer well clear of any water they are not certain is free of quippers.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Token artwork by Forgotten Adventures.</em></li>\n<li><em>Bestiary entry by Penelope (Vyrnali).</em></li>\n</ul>",

      "description": "<blockquote>\n<p>Strolling through the forest one spring morning I did find myself brought down to the earth by a most unusual hole gaping wide in the forest floor. Thinking myself a rather clever sleuth in finding some ill-witted bandit’s secret treasures, I did quickly reach my hand within the tunnel only to be greeted by something oddly fuzzy and a most severe pain to boot! Let my incident (and missing finger) with the woodland badger be warning to those lacking in wisdom; do not reach into places where your hand does not belong!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>- Merchant Lord Ellemond Doughty.</p>\n<p>The common forest dwelling badger is a creature of ingenuity and sheer determination. This creature, resembling a most rotund and powerful weasel, busies itself upon the forest floor catching its prey of insects and small mammals all the while toiling away at creating itself a sett, or more commonly called, a burrow. The badger’s coat is decked in marvelous black and white stripes running the length of its body. With gentle eyes and an otherwise calm demeanor, the badger exudes an image of a more timid beast; however, this outer appearance should be observed with caution. Armed with thick, elongated claws made for churning through the toughest of soil and a set of powerful jaws to match, badgers are quick to defend themselves should a foolish soul harass them. As long as you do not agitate the badger, it will find no recourse to harm you.</p>\n<p><strong>Miraculous Mandibles.</strong> A badger’s most intriguing feature is a set of peculiar jawbones with provide it with a spectacular method of defense. The animal’s jaws are set into long cavities within its skull allowing the badger to lock its jaws in place thus increasing its already powerful bite strength and avoid the possibility of mandible dislocation. A truly remarkable evolutionary advantage in avoiding combat (rather than confronting its adversary) is the badger’s natural odor. These creatures can release a powerful musk from scent glands located near their rears which can easily drive away predators. It is for these reasons that many forest dwelling cultures revere the badger as a guardian of the forest and attempt to utilize the badger’s unique abilities in their own bid for survival in the wilds of our world.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Token artwork by Forgotten Adventures.</em></li>\n<li><em>Bestiary entry by Penelope (Vyrnali).</em></li>\n</ul>",

Bats are a nocturnal creature prized by arcanists for their ability to navigate terrain in near total darkness. This alone makes them a prized choice for a summoned familiar. Varying from the size of a mouse to that of a house cat, bats have a unique feature amongst mammals: the gift of flight! Stretched thin between needle-thin boney “hands” are fleshy membranes which span out wide from the bat’s delicate body, allowing the bats to take to the skies in search of insects and woodland fruits to indulge upon.</p>\n<p><strong>Chitter Chatter.</strong> Presumed blind by many from nonsense tales told to children, bats have eyesight nearly akin to our own, though notably less sharp. What makes these creatures truly unique is their ability to navigate in the pitch black of night. The bats utilize a series of chirps and screeches researchers have dubbed “echolocation” to pinpoint objects or prey within their flightpath. The echolocation chirps emitted by the bats bounce back towards the tiny creature’s proportionally massive ears, allowing the bats to make split second corrections to their navigation without the aid of their eyes. It should be again noted that the bat makes a clever familiar choice, as they may navigate those places too dim and dangerous for our mortal eyes.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Token artwork by Forgotten Adventures.</em></li>\n<li><em>Bestiary entry by Penelope (Vyrnali).</em></li>\n</ul>",

      "description": "<p>Oh adventurer, were I able to precisely list every nature of cultists here for you, this tome would certainly span multitudinous volumes. Cultists, as their name describes, are those members of a secret underground society (or cult) whom very often practice a dark and unholy religion with their fellows. Beware adventurer! Not every cult is simply based around religious pretexts, there are those who seek political movements, those who are power hungry, and those who deign to meddle with forces our histories have lost long ago. Let me describe for you the very basics of common cult activity.</p>\n<p><strong>Friends on the Other Side.</strong> Cultists operate entirely in secrecy outside of the normal comings and goings of everyday life. What makes the cultist so fascinating is that they often attempt to blend seamlessly in with common folk: the barkeep at your favorite tavern, the guard near the gate, or even the dancer upon the stage may all be part of an underground community based ostensibly in evil. Now, to be clear, I do not encourage paranoia as cult activity is relatively rare in comparison to other, more immediate threats to our world; however, should a clever adventurer keep a keen eye out for secretive motions or gestures, odd symbols or markings, and even whispered code words, they can be certain they have stumbled into the workings of a cult. Quite commonly cultists align themselves with an ancient power trapped or dormant somewhere upon one of the more foul planes of existence. Their goals with this dark, godly force are myriad but often include control of a political structure, the deaths of hundreds if not thousands, or simply to sew despair and chaos across the realms of mortals. Unlike the desperate and cowardly bandits pushed to the brink by circumstance, cultists are often irredeemable foes. These men and women have been programed, brain-washed, or even directly controlled by their benefactor into the ways of darkness; often they are unfortunately unable to return to society once they have ingratiated themselves too deeply within the cult's network. Cults should always be handled and broken up with the utmost care; though the humanoid pawns behind the cult can be more easily dealt with, it should be remembered that cosmically evil forces may be at work and already set well into motion behind those pawns.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Token artwork by Forgotten Adventures.</em></li>\n<li><em>Bestiary entry by Penelope (Vyrnali).</em></li>\n</ul>",

As I peered into the first circle of the Nine Hells I did spy the quarry of my search with relative ease, The Maggot Pit. Here, deep within the valley of a parched and cracking mountain range lay a pit perhaps a mile in diameter, flanked all around by devilish guards. Within the milky pit writhed millions of ghostly pale worms, biting and squirming beneath their fellows. It was here that the lowly devils did bring up cart after cart piled high with the wretched and weakened souls of the pitiful dead, who were unceremoniously prodded to the edge of the pit and thrown within the writhing “waters” below. The sight of the lamentable being that emerged from that pool haunts my visions to this very day…&nbsp;<br><em>- Alaband the Curious, Mage in the Circle of the Constellar.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Wretched and foul, the Lemure is perhaps the weakest being to emerge shrieking from the Nine Hells into our plane of existence. Lemures resemble nothing more than a living ooze which has attempted to take the form of something vaguely humanoid. A malformed head with humanoid features sits atop the puddle of a creature, its pink and rotting flesh slithering beneath two stunted arms. Only able to cry out incoherently, the Lemure acts at the whim of its infernal masters, reduced in this form to a babbling fool. These creatures are the first troops sent through to another plane as the infantry in a never ending war which the Archdevils of the Nine Hells wage upon their foes. Though the Lemure has nearly no will of its own, the creature does have the strength to return to life should it be killed within its home of the Nine Hells. Be sure to pack a fair portion of holy water or utilize a Bless incantation should you slay on of these beasts in the realm of the devils, lest it only return to life within the Maggot Pit a few days after its demise.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Token artwork by Forgotten Adventures.</em></li>\n<li><em>Bestiary entry by Penelope (Vyrnali).</em></li>\n</ul>",

Hailing from roots similar to antelope and sheep, the goat has become a mainstay in the world of domesticated farm animals. Goats resemble something of a shorn sheep with thick, bristle-like fur and small hooves adorning their nimble feet. Atop the goat&rsquo;s head rests a set of hard horns which, depending upon the species, can vary from short and knobby to long curled protrusions. The goats use their horns for both defense and contests of strength between fellow males (or billies) during spectacular ramming matches. The clattering of mountain goats&rsquo; horns can be heard clearly throughout the valley towns during the creature&rsquo;s mating seasons.</p>\n<p><strong>Of Evil and Garbage.</strong> Goats can be called nothing if not resourceful when it comes to what they choose to ingest. Goats will typically feed upon grass and weeds found in their favored open fields; however, several shepherds have noted their goats eating such objects as iron nails, bits of discarded clothing, and even the wheels of a wagon! The image of a goat has also been co opted by some of the more nefarious of our realm as a symbol of evil to represent various foul cults. Perhaps it is the goat&rsquo;s sinister horizontal pupil that elicits fear in onlookers or their common use by some cultures as a ritualistic sacrifice that drives the cults to utilize their visage. No matter the cause, goats continue to be an integral though stubborn part of our everyday lives as their meat, milk, and utility in flocks makes them a hardy domesticated creature.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Token artwork by Forgotten Adventures.</em></li>\n<li><em>Bestiary entry by Penelope (Vyrnali).</em></li>\n</ul>",
